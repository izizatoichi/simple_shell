![jsss logo](/JSSS.png)

### Project details
-----
Welcome to the `Jian-Stephen Simple Shell` project! This program is a simple shell that can be compiled and launched from the command line within any number of Linux versions. It contains the most basic features and functions found in the various shell programs.


### Background
-----
The `Jian-Stephen Simple Shell` project is a major team project conducted by Jian Huang and Stephen Chu, students at Holberton School, for educational purposes. It consists of developing and makng our own clone of `DASH` - Debian Almquist shell found in several versions of Ubuntu Linux. Though cloning of `DASH` was the general guidance, having the same exact functionalities and features was not the goal. The goal for us was to learn and develop various team and individual skills regarding coding and git.

### Quick Start
-----
1. Git clone all this respository to your local directory.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/TrieToSucceed/simple_shell.git
```
2. Compile the program.
```
$ make all
```
3. Execute the shell.
```
$ ./hsh
```
Note: You can also run this shell in non-interactive mode, by simply piping your desired commands into the shell executable.

### Syntax
-----
When using this shell, the syntax for running any command follows the familiar syntax when running a command in any other shell:
```
JS$ <command> <flags or options> <argument 1> <argument 2> ...
```
In non-interactive mode:
```
$ <command> | ./hsh
```
#### Example
Interactive mode:
```
JS$ /bin/ls
```
or
```
JS$ ls -l
```
or
```
JS$ cat textfile
```
Non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
```

### Builtin Commands
-----
This shell supports a variety of builtin commands:

`alias` - create or list an alias

`cd` - change directory

`env` - list the current environment variables

`exit` - exit the shell

`help` - display help for a builtin command

`history` - display the command history for the current shell session

`setenv` - sets an environment variable

`unsetenv` - unsets an environment variable

*Note:* To read the help information and syntax for a particular builtin command, run the following from the shell prompt:
```
JS$ help <builtin command>
```

### Compilation
-----
Files are compiled this way:
```
$ make all
```

cd: cd [DIRECTORY]
	Change the shell working directory.

	Change the current working directory to DIRECTORY. If no directory is
	specified, then the current working directory will be set as the user's
	home directory defined in $HOME.

	If the directory is not found or directory does not have appropriate
	access permissions, an error message will be printed for the user.

	Options:
		No options are available. However, cd supports tilde (~) and
		hyphen (-) as DIRECTORY.

		Using the tilde will have the same effect as not specifying a
		DIRECTORY. The current working directory will be set as the
		user's $HOME directory.

		Using the hyphen will set the directory to the user's previous
		working directory.

	Exit Status:
		Returns 0 if directory successfully changes. Otherwise,
		error message will be displayed with exit status of 1.

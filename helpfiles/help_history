history: history
	Display list of past commands

	Display history of past commands in order of their execution. Each
	command will be displayed with a number on its own line.

	History will also store a list of the past commands in a file called
	".simple_shell_history" in the user's HOME directory upon exiting the
	shell. The file will be overwritten with new history every time user
	enters a new instance of the shell. The file will not contain line
	numbers and will only store up to 4096 commands (including blanks).

	Options:
		No available options.

	History:
		Return 0 if history is successfully displayed, or 1 if history
		fails to display to screen.
